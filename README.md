# Before using this action, consider writing a [C++/CMake/vcpkg based _pure_ workflow](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/master/.github/workflows/hosted-pure-workflow.yml)!

A __pure__ workflow is one without using special GitHub action that you cannot run locally on your development machine, but directly using the tools (`CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg`) you already use daily.
You can read more in this issue about it: https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake/issues/41

# [The **run-cmake@v10** action for using CMake with CMakePreset.json on GitHub workflows](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake)

The **run-cmake** action runs [CMake](https://cmake.org) on GitHub workflows by leveraging the configurations specified into [CMakePreset.json](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html).

Good companions are the [run-vcpkg](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg) action and the [get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) action.

Special features which provide added value over a pure workflow are:
  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. Customizable by the user.
  - annotations for `CMake` errors/warnings and for build (`gcc`/`msvc`/`clang`) errors/warning are created inline in the changed source files the build run for, e.g.: ![Annotation](./docs/imgs/annotation.png)
  - when necessary, it sets the environment to build with the MSVC toolset.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

## Quickstart

It is __highly recommended__ to use:
- [vcpkg as a submodule](#vcpkgsubmodule).
- a [vcpkg.json](#vcpkgjson) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.
- a CMakePreset.json file.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      #-uses: actions/cache@v1   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!

      # Install latest CMake.
      - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest
      # Or pin to a specific CMake version:
      # lukka/get-cmake@v3.21.2

      # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If a "cache miss" occurs,
      # then vcpkg is bootstrapped. Since a the vcpkg.json is being used later on
      # to install the packages when `run-cmake` runs, no packages are installed at
      # this time.
      - name: Restore artifacts, or setup vcpkg (do not install any package)
        uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v10
        #with:
          # This is the default location of the directory containing vcpkg sources.
          # Change it to the right location if needed.
          # vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'

          # If not using a submodule for vcpkg sources, this specifies which commit
          # id must be checkout from a Git repo. It must not set if using a submodule
          # for vcpkg.
          # vcpkgGitCommitId: '${{ matrix.vcpkgCommitId }}'

          # This is the glob expression used to locate the vpkg.json and add its
          # hash to the cache key. Change it to match a single manifest file you want
          # to use.
          # vcpkgJsonGlob: '**/vcpkg.json'

          # This is needed to run `vcpkg install` command (after vcpkg is built) in
          # the directory where vcpkg.json has been located. Default is false,
          # It is highly suggested to let `run-cmake` to run vcpkg (i.e. `false`)
          # (i.e. let CMake run `vcpkg install`) using the vcpkg.cmake toolchain.
          # runVcpkgInstall: true

      - name: Run CMake consuming CMakePreset.json and vcpkg.json by mean of vcpkg.
        uses: lukka/run-cmake@v10
        with:
          # This is the default path to the CMakeLists.txt along side the
          # CMakePresets.json. Change if you need have CMakeLists.txt and CMakePresets.json
          # located elsewhere.
          # cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/CMakeLists.txt'

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to use to generate
          # the project files. This configuration leverages the vcpkg.cmake toolchain file to
          # run vcpkg and install all dependencies specified in vcpkg.json.
          configurePreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to build the project.
          buildPreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'
```
